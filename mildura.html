              Final check is done, fuel air and water is and everything we need
              and more things we don’t need as well. We are on time to start
              this trip. Its how we planned to spend our december break. And its
              all happening. First big road trip for her and its bigger than
              last one for me.

              This is our first stop and had to stop for a picture. The Dog on
              the Tuckerbox is a monument and tourist attraction, few miles from
              Gundagai. It has a wishing pool and we did wish for a safe and fun
              trip.

              It almost lunch time and before that we happen to spot an
              abandoned tower Lincoln Oakbank Brewery. It is a majestic tower
              and can be seen anywhere from the tower. Took a quick snack break
              before lunch and headed towards our way.

              before we starve to death we need to stop for lunch and the
              temperature was soaring high that we went to the Bidgee Riverside
              Trail. I remembered this place was full of water in 2015 the last
              time I visited but now it’s with less water and there are few
              water ski sports happening and water is poisoned with algae. with
              bit of disappointment we had our lunch  and did a small trail walk
              and took some pictures and off we go.
